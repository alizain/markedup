# Plan of Action

1) Figure out the core language syntax

2) Create a simple implementation in JavaScript

3) Create a Word-like app that uses Markedup under the hood
OR
3) Create an online site for contracts that uses Markedup


## Fragmentation

Because the language is pretty open-ended in the way you can add components and corresponding renderers for those components, there is no doubt that there will be massive fragmentation in the language. Now, that's all great, but they key will be to get ahead of the fragmentation. The default language spec has really simple but really powerful components. That's great, but sooner or latter, people are going to come up with niche specific language extensions. We want to be in control of that.

**Markedup** is the language spec - open source, anyone can fuck with it any way they want.

**MarkedupJS** is the canonical JS implementation of the spec.

*Insert Company Name Here* is the company that owns Plan of Action (3) and that includes a series of canonical extensions to the language for specific work. For example, the company creates a canonical law related language extension, scientific paper related language extension, etc...
